# Guide to Scientific Computing in C++ exercises

This repository contains the code for (most) of the exercises provided in the book by Joe Pitt-Francis and Jonathan Whiteley. For the time being, the first chapters are omitted as they are very much introductory. Nonetheless, any beginners are welcome and even encouraged to do them to complete the repo!

## Contributing

To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork:

```console
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

3. Create a new branch to solve some exercises:

git checkout -b chapter-x
```

4. Commit and push to your fork:

```console
git push origin chapter-x
```

5. Create a Pull Request to the main repository.

### Directory structure

Before creating a Pull Request, make sure the structure of the directories used for the exercises follow the structure (for example, for chapter 4, exercise 5):

```
Chapter-4
└── 4-5
    ├── lib
        ├── header1.hpp
        ├── implementation1.cpp
    ├── main.cpp
    └── Makefile (if needed)
```
